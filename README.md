# World_Weather_Analysis

## The Purpose of this challange was to develop a vacation Itinerary, we had to get raw data using API key calls and convert the useful information to reach our goal.
The idea was to create somewhat of an application where we ask the user for their preferred temperature for vacation. We took that result and cleadned our data to match those parameter and used gmaps api's to create a a map with marker with the outcome locations. We then chose 4 cities and created an itenerary for the path of those nearby locations.
